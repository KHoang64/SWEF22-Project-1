A website I made in mind to include my portfolio.

I thought it would be cool if I used ThreeJS so while you scroll through the website, there will things happening in the background.

There are 5 gltf files that load so running this might take up the CPU/GPU to process however.

here is a video showcasing the website: https://imgur.com/a/Fc2i8Pp
