A bit about me:

I was born in Vietnam but my family moved to Tallmadge, Ohio. It's just a funny coincednce my name is also the same as the city of Kent.

In my free-time I love to make art, if thats draw both in an anime or more realistic art-style or trying my hand at 3d modeling.

I also like to listen to music, whether it be lofi beat tapes or video game soundtracks.

I like to play video games, some of my favorite titles being Pokémon Emerald, Mother 3, Omori, Celeste, Super Smash Brothers and Overwatch just to name a few. From playing video games I am inspired to learn about video game design and technicallity behind how they work. As a result it is one of my dreams to make a video game of my own that I am putting my all into so that it will be well made and fun to play.

My current aspiration is to finish a degree in Computer Science, Systems so I can continue a career as a full-time Software Develper, while in my free-time develop my indie game and release something I am proud in creating.
