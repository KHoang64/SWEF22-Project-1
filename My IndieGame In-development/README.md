Currently in production of developing a short single player First-Person Action-Adventure game, akin to Ability-Based parkour movement meets Souls-Like skill design and artistically inspired by the likes of The Legend of Zelda BOTW and Studio Ghibli. My main goal in making this game is to pay tribute to games I thoroughly enjoy: Overwatch, Competitive Super Smash brothers, Genshin Impact, etc.. and inspires me to make this game idea I have visualized in my head to that I want to design to be fun to play.

I am utilizing a rendering pipeline in Unity3D to achieve a stylized non-photo realistic look that is primarly targeted for Windows-PC but can be built for MacOS and Mobile platforms.
